# GithubSearch
A simple Github search engine in an android application

# Project Details
Initially, I wanted to create a more simple application but I realized that if I will spend time on this, I should make it worthwhile. 
I then took this as an opportunity to learn more about Jetpack Compose and the recommended technologies related to it.

### This application is using the following technologies:
1) Kotlin as the main programming language
2) Model View ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture
3) Jetpack Compose
4) HILT for Dependency Injection
5) Coil for Image Loading
6) Retrofit for API Communication

<i>The notable difference in an app developed using jetpack compose is that it does not need fragments and significantly fewer XML files</i>

### TO-DO
There are still some missing components in this app to showcase a more industry-accepted application so I will probably add them as I get more free time
1) ROOM Database - So the "settings" can persist across the application
2) State Hoisting - I implemented it on the composable(s) I developed but I believe I can still do better
3) Kotlin Multiplatform - This might be the end state that I wish to achieve
4) Animations/Transitions - For now I am still using default "material" behavior for the composable(s), I'll still do more research to make it better
5) Testing - This is pretty much self-explanatory
6) Modularization
